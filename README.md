A tool which can find your any document using **semantic search**

# What is Intelligent Document Finder ?
How easy do you find it to remember the exact location of a document that you created last year? Not very easy, right? Big Organizations/people deal with hundreds of documents daily and forget about them, most of the time.
<br>
But what if we want that old documentation again for some work, but unfortunately you do not remember the name or the actual content of that document to retrieve it from the large storage of your computer.
<br>
In such cases, use of a __Intelligent document finder__ can really make a huge difference. As, it can Search for the document(```sematically```) of your need based on a query input. This will not only help in faster access to the document, but will also help in grouping similar documents together and in analysing them.
